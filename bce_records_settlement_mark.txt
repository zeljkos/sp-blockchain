> is too big of a change?

● You're absolutely right! That's a pretty big structural change that would require updating:

  1. Database schema - RocksDB storage format changes
  2. API endpoints - Request/response formats
  3. Existing data - Migration of current records
  4. Serialization - All JSON parsing would need updates
  5. Smart contracts - Settlement logic updates
  6. Tests - All existing tests would break

  💡 Simpler Alternative Approach:

  Instead of changing the core BceRecord structure, we could add a separate settlement tracking table/collection:

  // Separate settlement tracking - no changes to BceRecord
  pub struct SettlementRecord {
      pub settlement_id: String,
      pub bce_record_ids: Vec<String>,  // Which BCE records were settled
      pub settlement_block: String,
      pub timestamp: u64,
      pub status: SettlementStatus,
  }

  This way:
  - ✅ No breaking changes to existing BceRecord structure
  - ✅ Existing data remains compatible
  - ✅ APIs don't need updates
  - ✅ Simple check before settlement: "Has this BCE record ID been settled before?"
