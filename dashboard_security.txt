  How It Works:
  - Global View: Available to all users (health data only)
  - Individual SP View: Requires API key authentication
  - Protected Endpoints: BCE records, settlement blocks, smart contracts
  - Authentication Flow: Modal → API key → Node validation → Access granted

  API Key Storage:
  - Keys stored only in memory during session
  - No persistent storage in browser/localStorage
  - Keys cleared when page refreshed

  Access Control:
  - Follows same pattern as scripts/read_blockchain_data_docker.sh:243,273
  - Uses Bearer token authentication with SP-specific keys
  - Validates against actual SP node endpoints
