 📊 Why Different SPs Have Different Record Counts

  What You're Seeing:
  - Total Blocks: 138 (across all SPs combined)
  - SP Records: 27-28 per individual SP
  - Math Check: 5 SPs × ~27-28 = ~135-140 blocks ✅

  This is Normal Because:

  1. Distributed Block Creation 🔄
    - Each SP creates blocks independently
    - Block creation isn't perfectly synchronized
    - Some SPs may create blocks slightly faster/slower
  2. Network Propagation Timing ⏱️
    - Blocks propagate across the P2P network
    - Small delays mean SPs might be 1-2 blocks apart temporarily
    - This is healthy distributed consensus behavior
  3. Byzantine Fault Tolerance Design 🛡️
    - Your 5-node consortium can handle up to 2 Byzantine failures
    - Slight differences prove the system is working independently
    - No single point of failure
