● 🎯 Final Phase: Monitoring & Observability

  We're now at the last phase! The 5-party SP consortium blockchain is fully functional with enterprise-grade security, but we need comprehensive monitoring and observability to complete
  the production-ready system.

  What we need to implement:

  📊 Metrics & Monitoring:

  - Prometheus metrics for all nodes
  - Performance tracking for ZKP operations, settlement processing
  - Blockchain health metrics (blocks, transactions, P2P connectivity)
  - Security metrics (authentication attempts, rate limiting)
  - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)

  📈 Observability Dashboard:

  - Real-time consortium health monitoring
  - Settlement processing visibility
  - P2P network topology visualization
  - ZKP performance tracking
  - Security event monitoring

  🚨 Alerting System:

  - Critical failures (node down, consensus issues)
  - Performance degradation alerts
  - Security incidents notifications
  - Settlement anomalies detection

  Multi-Party Ceremony Complexity

  Full Multi-Party Ceremony would mean:
  1. 5 separate processes (one per SP) each contributing randomness
  2. Sequential rounds where each party adds their entropy and passes to next
  3. Network coordination between parties during key generation
  4. Verification steps at each round to ensure no cheating
  5. Complex orchestration of the entire ceremony process


  Real Multi-Party Ceremony

  A production ceremony would involve distributed key generation with multiple rounds:

  Phase 1: Initialization

  - Each SP operator generates random toxic waste τᵢ
  - Creates initial contribution (αᵢ, βᵢ, γᵢ)
  - Publishes commitment without revealing secrets

  Phase 2: Sequential Contributions

  Round 1: T-Mobile-DE contributes τ₁
  Round 2: Vodafone-UK builds on τ₁, adds τ₂
  Round 3: Orange-FR builds on τ₁₊₂, adds τ₃
  Round 4: Telenor-NO builds on τ₁₊₂₊₃, adds τ₄
  Round 5: SFR-FR builds on τ₁₊₂₊₃₊₄, adds τ₅

  Phase 3: Verification

  - Each party verifies previous contributions
  - Checks pairing equations: e(g^α, h^β) = e(g^αβ, h)
  - Detects any malicious contributions

  Phase 4: Finalization

  - Final proving keys: PK = g^(τ₁·τ₂·τ₃·τ₄·τ₅)
  - Final verification keys: VK = h^(τ₁·τ₂·τ₃·τ₄·τ₅)
  - Toxic waste destruction ceremony

  Phase 5: Distribution

  - HSM Storage - Each SP stores keys in Hardware Security Modules
  - Multi-Signature Verification - Keys signed by all participants
  - Attestation Publishing - Public transcript with all proofs

  Phase 6: Ongoing Operations

  - Private Key Isolation - Proving keys never leave HSMs
  - Distributed Verification - Multiple parties verify each proof
  - Key Rotation - Periodic ceremonies for new keys

  Key Differences:
  - Demo: Single-party generation, shared via files
  - Production: Multi-party distributed generation, HSM storage, no single point of failure

  The real ceremony ensures no single party can forge proofs since they'd need to reconstruct the combined toxic waste from all participants.



--- fir demo ---
 For your demo, the pre-generated keys approach is much simpler:

  1. Single ceremony binary (like your trusted_setup_demo)
  2. Run once before containers start
  3. Generate keys that simulate what a real ceremony would produce
  4. All containers load the same keys
 What Should I Do?

  I think we should:
  1. Create a simple trusted setup binary (like your original)
  2. Generate keys before containers start
  3. Mount the keys into all containers
  4. Remove the ceremony code from container startup
